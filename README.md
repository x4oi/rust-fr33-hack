The experimentation with Evasion Techniques was part of my exploration. If you're aiming for an exceptionally secure cheat loader, there's a need for substantial enhancement in code and logic. Incorporating additional features for bolstering security becomes a necessity. My recommendation is to construct your custom loader with the singular objective of secure cheat distribution. Should you harbor an interest in this avenue, the provided link offers insights into crafting your own and acquainting yourself with the intricacies of game hacking. (Incidentally, I advise against employing SSL for paycheats; sticking to HTTPS suffices). Despite its current semblance as more of a DLL injector, this offering remains functional and imparts rudimentary security traits. Its utility thrives especially in contexts where exorbitantly priced cheats are absent, and the desire for a personalized creation is not pronounced.
